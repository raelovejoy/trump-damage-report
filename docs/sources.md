# Sources policy (starter)

- Prefer primary documents (court filings, executive orders, agency statements) when available.
- Require >= 2 reputable sources for "confirmed" unless a primary document exists.
- Always show citations (URLs) per incident.
- Use "contested" when only partisan claims exist or reporting conflicts.
